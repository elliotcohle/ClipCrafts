# Screenshots

To make the README more attractive on GitHub, add screenshots here.

## How to Add Screenshots

1. Take screenshots of the app in action
2. Save them in this folder as:
   - `main-dashboard.png` - Main dashboard view
   - `video-editor.png` - Video editing interface
   - `content-list.png` - Content list view

3. Reference them in the README:
   ```markdown
   ![Dashboard](screenshots/main-dashboard.png)
   ```

## Recommended Screenshots

- Main dashboard with content listed
- Video/Short creation modal
- Content package folder structure
- File editor views
- Status progression workflow

## Tips

- Use light mode for consistency
- Capture at 1920x1080 or higher
- Include some sample content (not real unpublished content)
- Crop out sensitive information
- Use macOS/Windows native screenshot tools
